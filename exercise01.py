Question 1
You are given a list of strings from which you want to generate all the unique
values.

For example, if you were given this list:

['a', 'A', 'b', 'B', 'B', 'A', 'a', 'c']
your result should contain these values:

['a', 'A', 'b', 'B', 'c']
Note that the order of the elements in the resulting list is not important.

You can use this list for this exercise.

l = ['AAPL', 'AAPL', 'Aapl', 'aapl', 'MSFT']
